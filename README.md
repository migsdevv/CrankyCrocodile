# CrankyCrocodile
A 3D game written in Java using the JMonkeyEngine. Created for our final project in my Programming 1 Class (taught by Sir. Jude Matthew Dominguiano) in DLSU-D SHS.

## DISCLAIMER
Please do not judge the code quality. This is my first time ever writing a game in Java, and all of this had to be completed in a span of a couple of days, so the code is bound to be terrible.

## FAQ
### Why JMonkeyEngine?
Originally, the plan was to code the game using a custom-made engine using LWJGL 3 (Lightweight Java Game Library 3). Unfortunately due to time constraints, we were not able to do this.

Thus, the decision was made to just use JMonkeyEngine, one of the few well-developed 3D game engines for Java.
